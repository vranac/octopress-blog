This is a digest from a bunch of information from the web.
If Flash is not working in your Chrome browser you may need to create the following symlink to get it working

{% codeblock lang:bash %}

sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins-wrapped/nswrapper_32_64.libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/

{% endcodeblock %}


As usual YMMV, have fun.
