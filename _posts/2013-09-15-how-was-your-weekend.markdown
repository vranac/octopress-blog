This weekend was kind of special.
Both [Robert Basic][robertbasic] and myself attended the [Zagreb PHP user group][zgphp] mini conference, and while this is not the first conference I attended, this was the first one that I did a tech talk on about [Vagrant & Puppet][slides](slides are in Serbian).

I will not try to recount the events, suffice to say that it was great and that if you are in the neighbourhood when the next one is organized (either [Zagreb PHP user group][zgphp] or [Webcamp Zagreb][wczg]) you should really go. Special shoutout goes to [Maja Bilic][bilicmaja] for her "(Mis)adventures of Women in tech" talk, if you have a chance, listen to her experiences, some eye-opening might occur.

I can't give enough praise to the three persons who are responsible for it [Miro Svrtan][mirosvrtan], [Luka Muzinic][lukamuzinic] and [Ivan Habunek][ivanhabunek], they did an awesome job, and thank you for giving me the chance to do my first talk.

While I do feel that my talk was ok, there is room for improvement. My mistake was not tuning out before my talk (ha ha n00b) and coming through as grumpier than I should have.

As I do intend to try and continue with talk(s) (if I figure out more subjects I am comfortable with sharing), I hope to improve my delivery.

As [Miro Svrtan][mirosvrtan] pointed out to me repeatedly, if you want to grow as a developer and/or person, find something you are passionate about, make a few slides, and do a talk, who knows, you might actually like it.

So... How was your weekend?
